		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<p>Download this repository to your computer.</p>
		<p>Keep track of (roughly) how long this takes you to complete from start to finish.</p>
		<p>Use Flexbox only. (No Floats or Grid.)</p>
		<p>Modify <strong>only</strong> <code>styles.css</code> and make the following changes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>For mobile views (device widths of 768px and above), display two <code>&lt;section class="card"&gt;</code>s per row.</li>
			<li>For desktop views (device widths of 1024px and above), display three <code>&lt;section class="card"&gt;</code>s per row.</li>
			<li>Make sure that there is adequate horizontal spacing between the cards when they are placed side by side.</li>
			<li>Set a max-width of 1280px on the <code>body</code> to prevent everything from looking too stretched out on extra large screen sizes.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>When you're finished, upload your project to GitHub and reply to the original assessment email with a link to your repository and the time it took you to complete.</p>
		
		<h3>Notes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>All the media queries that you will need are already in <code>styles.css</code>. You do not need to add any other media queries.</li>
			<li>Don't overthink this: It can be done in fewer than 10 lines of code.</li>
			<li>Need a Flexbox reminder? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">A Complete Guide to Flexbox</a></li>
			<li>Don't ask for help on this one. We want to see if you can do this on your own.</li>
			<li>If it's taking you beyond 1 hour to complete, stop there, reply to the email, and let me know.</li>
		</ul>
